		%h2 Questions people ask
		.clearsmall
		%h3 How long does the program last?
		%p Aim for 6 months, but you can complete the course as quickly or slowly as you like. There is no beginning date or end date. Stay with us as long as you feel like you need help and then branch out on your own as soon as you feel confident in your abilities.
		%h3 What will I be able to build when I'm done?
		%p If you complete the entire course plan, you'll be able to design, build and develop web applications with Ruby on Rails.
		%h3 What if can't complete the entire course plan?
		%p You can pause the program at any time if you need to take a break, and then pick up where you left off any time in the future. (This is a key differentiator from other developer bootcamp offerings.)
		%h3 Who should apply?
		%p This program is perfect for people who are serious about becoming a web developer, but don't have the ability to attend college or an in-person intensive course in another city.
		%h3 What is the time requirement for students?
		%p There is no time requirement. However, to glean the most value from the program, we encourage students to commit at least one hour every day to completing course materials, projects, and challenges.
		%h3 Do you accept overseas students?
		%p Yes, we love overseas students. (This is a key differentiator from other developer bootcamp offerings.)
		%h3 Will I need to buy special hardware or software?
		%p You'll need a modern computer running a current version of Mac OSX or Windows. You'll be working with Open Source software, which is free.
